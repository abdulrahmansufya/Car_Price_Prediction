#  Car Price Prediction - My First Machine Learning Project 🚗

This is my **first machine learning project**, where I created a simple model that can **predict the price of a car** based on information like brand, model, engine type, and body style.

##  Why I Built This 🌱

I wanted to learn how machine learning works from start to finish.  
In this project, I learned how to:

- Prepare and clean raw data
- Convert text features into numbers using `LabelEncoder`
- Train a simple **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn
- Give the model new car data and see what price it predicts

##  What the Data Looks Like 🧩

The data contains information about cars, such as:

- Brand  
- Model  
- Body type  
- Engine type  
- Registration status  
- Production year  
- EngineV  
- Mileage
- price

##  Tools Used ⚙️

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

##  What I Did 🧪

1. Cleaned the data and removed missing values  
2. Encoded categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`  
3. Trained a Linear Regression model  
4. Gave it new car details and predicted the price
